## Sales Pitch Summary

### For Users:
**"The launchpad where KOLs can't hide."**

- See exactly what every KOL holds before you buy
- Get alerts when KOLs sell
- Track on-chain performance, not promises
- No more hidden bags, no more silent dumps

### For KOLs:
**"Build trust. Earn more."**

- Prove your track record on-chain
- Earn tokens proportional to volume you generate
- Transparent = trustworthy = more followers
- Performance-based rewards, not upfront payments

### The Differentiator:
**Pump.fun + Livestreaming + On-Chain KOL Transparency**

Every other launchpad lets KOLs shill in secret. BMBM makes every position, every trade, every earn visible on-chain.
